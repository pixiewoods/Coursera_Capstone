Problem Description

My hypothetical problem revolves around opening a small music entertainment club within some neighborhood in San Francisco. 
The club would not only offer evening entertainment but would ideally be used to offer some music classes and instruction.  
I am looking for a thriving neighborhood in which residents would attend events.

Background

I will assume that part of what I will use as a new business owner to make my decision has to do with city residents and their
basic demographics.  

•	Ability to afford entertainment.  A middle-class population has some cash for discretionary spending. 
•	Reasonably priced homes.  A business owner may ideally want to live within the community where his/her business is located. 
•	Population volume.  There must be a good size adult population within the community to patronize the club.
•	Crime rate.  Obviously, opening a club in a low crime area would be ideal.

Another major decision factor is whether music club venues already exist in these communities.  Establishing a new club 
where there is less competition makes sense.
