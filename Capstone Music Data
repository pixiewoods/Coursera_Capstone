Foursquare Venue Data
Foursquare venues will be collected for neighborhoods within San Francisco.  This data will help to illustrate the music club 
competitors.  Categories searched will include music venue and performing arts venue.

Data Usage

I’m not finding available free demographic data, so I’ll go with using just crime reports and Foursquare venue data.  
I’ll segment neighborhoods by crime level and presence of existing clubs.  Quite simply, a low crime and low venue count 
neighborhood will be considered ideal for a new venue.
